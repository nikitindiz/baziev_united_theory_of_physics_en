### State of gas thermodynamics.

In molecular physics, the concept of an "ideal gas," which allows no interaction between molecules, prevails. There is an equation of state for an ideal gas, derived by B. Clapeyron in 1834 and generalized by D. I. Mendeleev in 1874 to the form:

$$PV = nRT = \frac{m}{\mu} \cdot RT \quad (1.1)$$

The state of real gases agrees with this equation only in a narrow range of pressures, near normal conditions. There are also empirical equations (the Van der Waals equation and the virial equation) containing a number of correction coefficients and therefore agreeing more with the state of real gases, but they in no way touch upon the interaction between molecules.

World science has been studying gases since 1652, from the moment R. Boyle discovered the relationship between pressure and volume. But to this day, the nature of real gases remains undisclosed, and there is no equation describing the true state of gases.

Thanks to the efforts of J. Waterston, A. KrÃ¶nig, R. Clausius, J. Maxwell, and L. Boltzmann, since the mid-19th century, statistics has become the main tool in the study of gases. This direction substituted the consideration of the physical essence of the interaction of real molecules with a mathematical game describing probabilistic events. It is this direction that led the theory of gases into the dead end in which it remains today.

The Boltzmann (implicitly) and Planck constants were derived simultaneously, in one article by M. Planck [1] from 1900. The first of these constants is widely used in gas thermodynamics, while the Planck constant is not used at all. Everyone thought and still thinks that the Planck constant has no relation to the state of real gases. And this, as will be shown below, is a profound delusion.

According to existing concepts, gases lack any structure, and the continuum of particles is formed by molecules moving randomly in all directions and colliding chaotically. This creates the appearance of a correct interpretation of gas pressure exerted on a wall by the number of molecules colliding with it. At the same time, it remains completely unclear how to explain the pressure within an elementary volume $\Delta V = 1/N$, where $N$ is the volume density of particles. It cannot be described by methods of statistical physics. A new, purely physical approach to solving problems of molecular physics is needed.

### Kinetic energy of the oscillator and its individual space.

Classical molecular physics is based on the fact that the kinetic energy of gas molecules can be described in two ways: mechanically $E = mv^2/2$ and thermodynamically $E = 3kT/2$. From these relations, the linear velocity of molecules of the form $v = \sqrt{3kT/m}$ is derived, where $m$ is the mass of the molecule, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the thermodynamic temperature of the gas.

I have obtained new results indicating that the kinetic energy of molecules is thermodynamically defined as $E = kT$ and that $E \neq mv^2/2$. But before proceeding to the analysis of these results, it is necessary to introduce the concept of "oscillator" instead of molecules and atoms. Since, as will be shown below, the most characteristic and general property of structural elements of gases, liquids, and solids is their hyperfrequency oscillations, the term "oscillator" reflects the universal property of matter particles regardless of its aggregate state.

Let us turn to the objectively existing barometric pressure. Let us take for analysis a unit volume of air under normal conditions $V_{ed} = 1 \, m^3$. What is the total kinetic energy of the oscillators of this volume? It is obvious and generally accepted that $E_{ed} = V_{ed} \cdot P_0 = 1.01325 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{J}$. Since $V_{ed}$ consists of $N_0$ oscillators, the energy of one average oscillator is correctly determined from the relation:

$$E_0 = P_0 \cdot V_{ed}/N_0 = P_0 \cdot V_{g0} \quad (1.2)$$

where $V_{g0}$ is the volume of the globule, the individual space of the oscillator. The oscillator and its individual space constitute an inseparable unity, and the name "globule" reflects the fact that this elementary volume has a spherical shape. The volume of the globule is most simply and naturally determined from the general relation

$$V_{gi} = m_i/\rho_i \quad (1.3)$$

where $m_i$ is the mass of the oscillator, and $\rho_i$ is the mass density of the gas. Calculation for the average air oscillator gives:

$$V_{g0} = m_Ð² / \rho_{0Ð²} = \frac{4.8106712 \cdot 10^{-26} \text{ kg}}{1.2929 \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-3}} = 3.7208378 \cdot 10^{-26} \text{ m}^3 \quad (1.4)$$

$$N_0 = 1/V_{g0} = 2.6875667 \cdot 10^{25} \, \text{m}^{-3} \quad (1.5)$$

$$E_0 = P_0 \cdot V_{g0} = 3.7701389 \cdot 10^{-21} \text{ J} \quad (1.6)$$

The same value of the kinetic energy of the oscillator can be obtained through the Boltzmann constant:

$$E_0 = k_Ð² T_{0Ð²} = 1.3802449 \cdot 10^{-23} \cdot 273.15 = 3.7701389 \cdot 10^{-21} \quad (1.7)$$

And what is the value of $E_0$ following from classical theory?

$$E_0' = \frac{3}{2}k_Ð² T_{0Ð²} = 5.6552083 \cdot 10^{-21} \, \text{J} \quad (1.8)$$

$$v_0' = \sqrt{3k_Ð² T_{0Ð²}} / m_Ð² = 484.88242 \, \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1} \quad (1.9)$$

$$E_0 = \frac{m_Ð² (v_0')^2}{2} = 5.6552083 \cdot 10^{-21} \text{ J} \quad (1.10)$$

From a comparison of (1.8â€”1.7), it follows clearly that the formulas of classical theory overestimate the result by 1.5 times. And the matter here does not come down to a simple adjustment of $v_0'$ or the coefficient 3/2, but is of a deeply fundamental nature. The main error of classical theory lies in the fact that it never considered the meaning of the individual space of the oscillator and the physical essence of the interaction between oscillators, because its development went along the path of widespread introduction of mathematical statistics methods into gas analysis. It is this circumstance that did not allow classical theory to rise to the understanding that the main form of motion in the microworld is hyperfrequency oscillation, which is based on the physical interaction between oscillators. One of the proofs of the fallacy of the statistical approach to gas analysis is precisely the coefficient 3/2 in the oscillator energy equation. Thus, statistics asserts that the motion of molecules is chaotic, they rush in all directions, colliding randomly with each other. Such a form of motion is allegedly described by the equation

$$E_0' = \frac{1}{2} E_x + \frac{1}{2} E_y + \frac{1}{2} E_z = \frac{3}{2} k T_{0Ð²}$$

It is perplexing that throughout the entire period of development of molecular physics, no one has subjected the correctness of the formula $E = mv^2/2$ as applied to gas particles to elementary analysis. Meanwhile, it is absolutely incorrect in molecular physics, because it describes the energy of a body moving along a second-order curve. For example, the energy of the Earth's motion in the Sun's gravitational field will be

$$E = m u \cdot \frac{2\pi}{T} \cdot a = m u \cdot n \cdot a = m u \cdot u = m u^2$$

where $m$ is the mass of the Earth, $u$ is the orbital velocity, $T$ is the period of revolution, $n$ is the angular measure of orbital motion, and $a$ is the average radius of the orbit.

### Frequency form of oscillator motion.

Let us continue the analysis started. Let us turn to the consideration of pressure in the macro-volume $V_{ed}$ and the elementary volume $V_{g0}$. When explaining gas pressure, it is customary to speak of the total instantaneous force of molecules on a wall of unit area. But what if there is no wall? Why can't we talk about gas pressure inside a volume, regardless of any surface? After all, no one doubts that there is real pressure at any point in the macro-volume of an equilibrium gas system. What is the pressure in the elementary volume $V_{g0}$, what determines it, and in what units is it measured? For the macro-volume and the globule, we have:

$$P_0 = \frac{E_{ed}}{V_{ed}} = 1.01325 \cdot 10^5 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{m}^3} \quad (1.12)$$

$$P_0 = \frac{k_Ð² T_{0Ð²}}{V_{g0}} = 1.01325 \cdot 10^5 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{m}^3} \quad (1.13)$$

This is the natural dimension for pressure in gases and liquids. Both in elementary and macro volumes, gas pressure is the volumetric concentration of energy!

It is easy to see that the volumetric concentration of energy and the unit of pressure Pa are equimodular quantities:

$$\frac{\text{J}}{\text{m}^3} = \frac{\text{N} \cdot \text{m}}{\text{m}^2 \cdot \text{m}} = \frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}^2} = \text{Pa} \quad (1.14)$$

The introduction of the concept of a globule into gas analysis marks a very important qualitative transition from the macro-volume of gas to its elementary constituent, from statistics to the consideration of the physical essence of interaction between oscillators. Think about the physical content of the globule. What form of motion must a gas molecule possess to constantly maintain a near-molecular elementary volume of space around itself and evenly fill it with energy, causing pressure $P_0$ in it? The answer is one â€” only frequency motion! It is quite obvious that the uniform distribution of pressure throughout the volume $V_{ed}$, the equal filling of all globules forming this volume with energy, is possible only with the ordered motion of each oscillator. And the orderliness of motion is a property of the hyperfrequency oscillation of an oscillator with an amplitude meeting the condition $A_0 \leq d_{g0}$, where $d_{g0}$ is the globule diameter.

Thus, a globule is an elementary unit of a macro-volume of gas and liquid, which combines the unity of mass, energy, and space, as well as, as we will see below, electric charges. That is, all elements forming the material world of the Universe are present in this microscopic formation.

Let us consider the most important features of the frequency motion of an oscillator. Its kinetic energy will be described by the Planck formula

$$E_0 = h f_0 \quad (1.15)$$

where $h$ is the Planck constant, $f_0$ is the frequency of oscillation of the oscillator inside the volume of the globule $V_{g0}$ at temperature $T_0$. For the sake of fairness, it must be said that, starting from the moment of the discovery of the Planck constant to this day, everyone considers the value $h$ to be a quantum of radiant energy and nothing more. Upon careful study of M. Planck's work [2], anyone can verify that the Planck formula $\varepsilon = h\nu$ is the kinetic energy of an oscillator radiating light, i.e., the kinetic energy of structural elements of a heated black body. However, neither M. Planck himself nor anyone else before me considered the possibility of applying this formula to describe the energy of an oscillator in gases and liquids. This is a historical fact, but nevertheless, it seems incredible.

The frequency of the oscillator is determined from the relations:

$$f_0 = \frac{E_0}{h} = \frac{P_0 \cdot V_{g0}}{h} = \frac{kT_0}{h}, \text{ s}^{-1} \quad (1.16)$$

The amplitude of oscillation of the oscillator at this stage can be taken equal to the diameter of the spherical globule, and we will obtain the exact solution somewhat later.

$$A_0 \approx d_{g0} = \sqrt[3]{6V_{g0}/\pi}, \text{ m} \quad (1.17)$$

where $A_0$ is the amplitude of oscillation of the oscillator, $d_{g0}$ is the diameter of the globule. Inserting its value from (1.4) into (1.17) instead of $V_{g0}$, we get

$$A_0 \approx d_{g0} = \sqrt[3]{6m / \pi \rho_0} \quad (1.18)$$

To determine the linear velocity of air molecules, let us express the frequency without the participation of the Planck constant

$$f_0 = v_0/2A_0 \approx v_0/2d_{g0} \quad (1.19)$$

where $v_0$ is the linear velocity of an average air molecule, $2A_0$ is the path of the molecule during one period of its reciprocating motion. From (1.16) and (1.19) follows the equality

$$\frac{kT_0}{h} = \frac{v_0}{2A_0} \approx \frac{v_0}{2d_{g0}} \quad (1.20)$$

solving which with respect to $v_0$, we obtain

$$v_0 = \frac{2A_0 \cdot kT_0}{h} \approx \frac{2d_{g0} \cdot kT_0}{h},\, \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1} \quad (1.21)$$

The numerical values of the main quantities of the frequency motion of air molecules (in normal conditions) turned out to be the following:

$f_0 = 5.6875667 \cdot 10^{12} \text{ s}^{-1}$ â€” exact value

$d_{g0} = 4.1420376 \cdot 10^{-9} \text{ m}$ â€” exact value

$v_0 = 4.713379 \cdot 10^4 \, \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$ â€” approximate, exceeds the exact one by 0.00438%

These results irrefutably testify that gas molecules possess hyperfrequency oscillatory motion and that the gas is formed by a continuum of globules and has a globular structure with a coordination number $K = 12$. This is the most important phenomenon and property of real gases, previously unknown to us.

Now we can write a system of three equations for calculating the oscillator energy

$$
\begin{cases}
    E_0 = P_0 \cdot V_{g0} \\
    E_0 = k T_0 \\
    E_0 = h \cdot f_0
\end{cases}
$$

Analyzing this system, one cannot fail to see that the oscillator is faceless in it, i.e., the main parameter of a real molecule â€” its mass â€” is missing. If this thermodynamic system is correct, then there must certainly exist a mechanical equation for the energy of the oscillator. Observing diffusion in gases and liquids, one can conclude that globules possess a certain mobility accessible to visual observation. It follows from this that gas oscillators possess not only a colossal linear velocity in the coordinates of the globule but also a wandering velocity of the globule, continuously changing its coordinates in the macro-volume. In other words, in the volume of the globule, the oscillator possesses reciprocating motion with a linear velocity $v_0$, and simultaneously with this, the globule wanders through the volume occupied by the gas with a velocity $u_0$. Comprehension of this phenomenon led to the derivation of a unique equation, named the mechanical equation of the oscillator:

### Mechanical expression of oscillator energy and molecular wandering velocity.

$$E_0 = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4\pi}{3} (mv_0 \cdot u_0)^3} \quad (1.22)$$

where $u_0$ is the wandering velocity of the globule. Getting rid of the root, we get

$$E_0 = mv_0u_0 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4\pi/3} = mv_0 \cdot u_0 \cdot a \quad (1.23)$$

where $a = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4\pi}{3}} = 1.611992 \text{ rad } = 92.360338 \text{ degree }$ is, on the one hand, the coefficient of sphericity of the globule, and on the other â€” the average angle of reflection of an oscillator from an oscillator as a result of their interaction, which we will talk about in detail below. The wandering velocity will be determined from (1.23)

$$u_0 = \frac{E_0}{m v_0 a} = \frac{P_0 \cdot V_{g0}}{m v_0 \cdot a} = \frac{k T_0}{m v_0 a} = \frac{h f_0}{m v_0 a} = \frac{h}{2 A_0 \cdot ma}, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \quad (1.24)$$

The exact numerical value for air is $u_0 = 1.0315148 \text{ m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$. Now the oscillator energy equation acquires a complete form

$$E_0 = P_0 V_{g0} = kT_0 = hf_0 = mv_0u_0a \quad (1.25)$$

and receives the status of the main equation of hyperfrequency mechanics, a fundamentally new section completely displacing quantum mechanics from science. Here it is appropriate to say that among A. Einstein's delusions there is one absolutely correct idea. He asserted that the true theory of physics must necessarily be causal. It was this conviction that did not allow him to accept quantum mechanics, entirely based on statistics. Hyperfrequency mechanics is exactly what Einstein dreamed of.
